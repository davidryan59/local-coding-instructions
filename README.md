## Instructions
*General instructions here for setting up my local code directory*

This README contains a suggested directory structure for local code, as well as how to use each directory.

Also in this folder are general instructions for doing specific things.

### Directory structure
Recommend to use the following directories:
- archive
- forks
- my_npm_packages
- play
- projects
  - <language 1>
  - <language 2>
- temp_clones

### play
Each directory in here should be temp / disposible directories that I have used to test out a new idea

### projects
- Categorise my projects by language subfolder
- Make 2nd level subfolder for each project
- Each project should be saved to GitHub
- Try not to keep many local temporary files. Instead use GitHub Issues etc
- Any credentials - save a copy elsewhere

### my_npm_packages
- Special type of projects, which end up as npm Javascript modules - see `NPM instructions.md`

### temp_clones
Clone other people's repositories to inspect their code

### forks
Fork other people's repositories when I start to make any changes, that I might want to send back with a pull request

### archive
Anything that I am no longer developing but don't want to remove entirely yet.
